Goal:
This small data visualization project aimed to summararize data for a biking company. Using three datasets in combination with SQL, I was able to identify peak business hours, the demographics of riders, and the revenue over time.

Reflection:
This is my very first venture into using SQL and I was pleasantly surprised! Power BI connects directly to your SQL server and can update information as it is manipulated. I found it to be very straightforward and am very interested in creating a larger scale web application that implements relational databases in the near future. This short and sweet project was mainly to get exposure to the development enviroment for SQL.
