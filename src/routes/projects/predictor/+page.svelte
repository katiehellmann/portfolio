Goal:
This project was a Next.js practice exercise made with the help of a youtube tutorial. I am always looking to learn new frameworks and was pleasantly surprised that my existing skills were easily transferrable to this application.

Beyond the tutorial, I: 
&nbsp- Styled the UI myself using Tailwind CSS.
&nbsp- Hosted the app using Vercel because of its simplicity and existing integrations with Next.js.
