Goal:
This mockup desktop website was a practice exercise for me to better my skills in Figma. I aimed to make a website for a farm that sells bee products, but also had a coehesive family friendly farm vibe to it.

Reflection:
I've used Axure RP 10 before, so prototyping with Figma was nothing new to me. However, I was limited with the free plan of Figma, so I was only able to add small amounts of interactivity to the prototype.
