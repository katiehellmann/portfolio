Game Overview: 
Four adventure-seeking college kids and their dog friend embark on the beginning of their paranormal journey when they find the Hand Hook Car Man, who takes all of their souls and combines them into their ghost hunting truck. Now they have to work together and dodge and collect spirits and cryptids to hunt down the Hand Hook Car Man and return to their human bodies.
