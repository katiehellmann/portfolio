Goal:
This project was a Next.js practice exercise made with the help of a youtube tutorial. It is entirely functional and can take in a fake card number (ex: 4242424242424242), future exp. date, and random CVC. This project really challenged me into creating a functional application that has real-world applications.

Beyond the tutorial, I: 
&nbsp- Styled the UI myself using TailwindCSS, roughly according to my Figma Mockup (still working on it!).
&nbsp- Added some extra elements, and improved existing ones.
&nbsp- Hosted the app using Vercel because of its simplicity and existing integrations with Next.js.
