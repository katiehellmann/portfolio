                At this point of time, I'm looking for work! In the meantime, I'm improving myself by working on my credentials and learning new frameworks. Formally, I graduated cum laude from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Game Development with a minor in Business Administration. During my time there, I worked on tons of game projects with my peers, participated in 7 hackathons (and won one!), worked on the <a href="echoes-vip.org" target="_blank" class="link hover:text-accent-500">Echoes VIP website</a>, studied abroad, and was apart of the Electric Vehicle Team as the Marketing and Sponsor Relations manager.

                I'm from small-farmtown northeastern Iowa, and found my love for coding in highschool. Being from somewhere where there was almost no support for computer science at the time, I had to actively seek knowledge myself. I took the time to advocate for my own interests and took AP computer science courses instead of study hall.

                Now, I am working on creating fun, but meaningful web applications. I hope to keep creating them, too! Check out my projects (new and old) below!
