I got my degree from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Game Development with a minor in Business Administration. During my time there, I worked on tons of game projects with my peers, participated in 7 hackathons (and won one!), worked on the <a href="echoes-vip.org" target="_blank" class="link hover:text-pink-400">Echoes VIP website</a>, and was apart of the Electric Vehicle Team as the Marketing and Sponsor Relations manager.</p> <br> <p>I'm from small-farmtown northeastern Iowa, and found my love for coding in highschool. Being from somewhere where there was almost no support for computer science at the time, I had to actively seek knowledge myself. I took the time to advocate for my own interests and took AP computer science courses instead of study hall.</p> <br> <p>Now, I am working on creating fun, but meaningful web applications. I hope to keep creating them, too!</p></div></div></div></div>`);function r(e){var t=n();a(e,t)}export{r as component};
